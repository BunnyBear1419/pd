# Stage 53 — Gameplay and multiplayer QA

## Purpose
Run a structured test matrix for floors, rooms, routes, doors, vehicles, roof access and multiplayer streaming.

## Workflow
1. Back up the last accepted Blender scene and exported resource.
2. Use the approved outputs of Stages 36–38 as review references, not as authoritative construction plans.
3. Complete the work in the real Blender/Sollumz/CodeWalker/FiveM toolchain.
4. Run applicable audits, inspect findings manually, and retain evidence.

## Acceptance checklist
- [ ] Test spawn/reconnect/resource restart
- [ ] walk and drive routes
- [ ] inspect every room with multiple clients
- [ ] record and retest defects
- [ ] Record tool versions, evidence, defects, reviewer and date.
- [ ] Do not treat CI/package success as proof of external toolchain or in-game validity.

## Status boundary
This stage defines the work package and acceptance gate. It is not complete until the real work and evidence exist. Do not claim production readiness without successful export, CodeWalker inspection and FiveM testing.
