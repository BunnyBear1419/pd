# Stage 54 — Release packaging and documentation

## Purpose
Prepare a versioned release bundle only after exported resource and test matrix pass.

## Workflow
1. Back up the last accepted Blender scene and exported resource.
2. Use the approved outputs of Stages 36–38 as review references, not as authoritative construction plans.
3. Complete the work in the real Blender/Sollumz/CodeWalker/FiveM toolchain.
4. Run applicable audits, inspect findings manually, and retain evidence.

## Acceptance checklist
- [ ] Include install/rollback steps, known limitations, tool versions, asset manifest and changelog
- [ ] exclude review artifacts from runtime resource
- [ ] Record tool versions, evidence, defects, reviewer and date.
- [ ] Do not treat CI/package success as proof of external toolchain or in-game validity.

## Status boundary
This stage defines the work package and acceptance gate. It is not complete until the real work and evidence exist. Do not claim production readiness without successful export, CodeWalker inspection and FiveM testing.
